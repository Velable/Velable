- 👋 Hi, I’m @Velable
- 👀 I’m interested applications of data analysis techniques and use of data science methods and tools in real life situations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Python, how to use Git and Quarto, a bit on linux and trying to wrap my head around OOP.
- 💞️ Currently I am working on a Shiny R application for VaR-like measure calculation on a user-defined portfolio (based on Yahoo Finance Database).
